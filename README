This is part of my BSc thesis.

To compile the project you will need to install opencv, on Ubuntu 12:04 you can run:

sudo apt-get install libcvaux-dev libcv-dev libhighgui-dev

To run the live example you will also need:

sudo apt-get install python-gst0.10

Since it uses python + gstreamer to capture live video and integrates it with the lencod.

Then a simple "make" call should compile the entire project. (if OpenCV doesnt change its API and breaks everything :-)
