\begin{abstract}

To store and transmit video the use of encoders has been increasing, MPEG 4 part 10, also known as H.264, stands out among these encoders. This work integrates the Haar classifier to the reference MPEG 4 part 10 encoder to detect objects and explores the motion estimation algorithm of the encoder to track the detected objects. Detected objects and tracking information are represented in the form of metadata and bitstream are transported in the video messages using Supplemental Enhancement Information.

In the reference decoder, metadata is retrieved and presented in order to satisfactorily carry out the verification of the proper functioning of the object detection implemented in the encoder. The tests showed that the generated video is in accordance with the MPEG 4 part 10, together with a satisfactory computational performance. The results obtained in the decoder, retrieving the metadata and presenting them, were also satisfactory, showing the viability of building a object tracking system embedded on the encoder.
